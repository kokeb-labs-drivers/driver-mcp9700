 * @brief The version getters follow the generated mcp9700_version.h, so they
 * cannot drift from CMake.
 *
 * Built twice by tests/CMakeLists.txt: against the real generated header (the
 * getters must equal the CMake project version, passed as EXPECTED_*), and
 * against a probe header generated from the same template with version 9.8.7 (a
 * getter that returns a literal instead of reading the header fails there).
